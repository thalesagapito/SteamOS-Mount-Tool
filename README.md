Hello!

Welcome to the Easy Mount Tool for SteamOS.

This is a simple tool to help you permanently set up any extra drive (like an SD card or a Windows partition) on your SteamOS device. After using this tool, your drive will be ready automatically every time you start your device, and you won't have to worry about it again.

**Here's how to get it working in just a few simple steps:**

1.  First, download the launcher file by clicking the big link below. It will be saved directly to your `Downloads` folder.

    [➡️ **Click Here to Download the Easy Mount Tool** ⬅️](https://github.com/thalesagapito/SteamOS-Mount-Tool/releases/download/v1.0/Easy-Mount-Tool.desktop)

2.  Next, open your file manager (the blue folder icon in the taskbar), go into your `Downloads` folder, and drag the **`Easy-Mount-Tool.desktop`** file onto your Desktop.

3.  Now, just **double-click** the new icon on your Desktop and choose **"Execute"** from the window that pops up.

4.  A prompt will ask for your admin password. This is necessary for the script to set up the system files correctly.

5.  After you enter your password, a terminal window will open and the script will guide you through the rest. Just follow the on-screen instructions.

That's it!

**Troubleshooting Tip**

If double-clicking the file opens it in a text editor instead of running it, your system needs you to give it permission once. To do this, open a Terminal and run this one command: `chmod +x ~/Desktop/Easy-Mount-Tool.desktop`. After that, it will work with a double-click forever.
